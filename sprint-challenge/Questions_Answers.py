"""
QUESTIONS:
1) What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?

2) We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?
"""


"""
ANSWERS:
1) I think it's important to get a different set of eyes (and computing power)
onto code to test it from different angles. I appreciate when they include
screenshots of successful and/or error messages.

2) Containers are like miniaturized virtual machines. Virtual machines reduce
the need for heavy local computing power by providing access to cloud-based
computing hardware. Virtual machines run bulky operating systems, but
containers break it down to the bare necessities by providing something simple,
small, and portable: a basic terminal. Containers are oftentimes used in testing
the functionability of code in different environments and running for bugs:
product quality testing.
